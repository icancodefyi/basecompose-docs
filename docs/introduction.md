# Introduction

Welcome to **Basecompose** – your all-in-one, open-source solution for building modern web applications with the help of AI.

## What is Basecompose?

Basecompose is a developer tool that lets you create full-stack applications by simply describing what you want in plain English. It uses advanced AI to understand your requirements and generates:

- A frontend (user interface) using Next.js
- A backend (API/server) using Node.js or FastAPI
- A database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)
- Authentication (login/signup with Auth.js)
- Docker Compose files for easy local development and cloud deployment
- All configuration, environment files, and setup guides

You don’t need to be an expert in every technology. Just describe your app, and Basecompose does the heavy lifting. It’s like having a senior developer and DevOps engineer on your team, 24/7.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Describe Your App:** Use the chat interface to tell the AI what you want (e.g., “I need a blog with login and a database”).
2. **AI Builds Your Stack:** The AI selects the right technologies, resolves dependencies, and configures everything for you.
3. **Download & Run:** Instantly download your project as a ZIP file. Unzip, follow the setup guide, and you’re live!
