# Introduction

Welcome to Basecompose!

Basecompose is a free and open-source tool that helps you build full-stack web applications quickly and easily. You can use simple English to tell the AI what kind of app you want, and Basecompose will generate all the code, configuration, and setup instructions for you.

## What is Basecompose?

Basecompose is like a smart assistant for developers. It uses AI to understand your needs and creates a ready-to-run project with:
- Frontend (user interface)
- Backend (server logic)
- Database (data storage)
- Authentication (login/signup)
- Docker Compose files (for easy deployment)

You don’t need to be an expert in every technology. Just describe your app, and Basecompose does the heavy lifting.
