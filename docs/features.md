# Features Overview

Basecompose is packed with features to help you build modern web apps faster and easier. Here’s what you get:

## 1. AI-Powered Stack Configuration
You can chat with the AI in plain English. Just say what you want (e.g., “I need a Next.js app with MongoDB and Google login”) and Basecompose will set up everything for you.

## 2. Full Stack Templates
Choose from pre-built templates for frontend, backend, database, and authentication. All templates are production-ready and follow best practices.

## 3. Docker-Ready
Basecompose generates Docker Compose files for both development and production. This means you can run your app locally or deploy it to the cloud with minimal setup.

## 4. Instant Download
Once your stack is ready, you can download the entire project as a ZIP file. Unzip it, and you’re ready to code or deploy.

## 5. Smart Dependency Resolution
Basecompose automatically figures out what dependencies your stack needs. For example, if you add authentication, it will also add a database if required.

## 6. Extensible Technology Catalog
You can easily add new technologies or customize existing ones. All options are managed in a single config file, making it simple to extend.

## 7. Easy Customization
Edit the generated code to add your own features, UI, or business logic. The code is clean and well-organized.

## 8. Open Source & Community Driven
Basecompose is open source. Anyone can contribute, suggest features, or report bugs.
